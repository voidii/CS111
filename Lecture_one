  Important statement: import library
    Example:
      import math
      f = math.factorial(N)
      
      import math as m
      *******
  Basic variable types: int, str, float, bool(True/False)
  Other variable types: list(can have different type of element), turples(it is not changable)
    List example:
      l = [1, 2, 'x']
    Turples example
      t = (1, 2, 3)
  Easy to convert from one type to another
    Example:
      a = 2
      b = str(a)
      print b
      "2"
  Input, always gets a string as a input
  Conditionals
  For-loops
    Example:
      for x in (1, 2, 3): # for x in range(11):
        print(x)
  While loop
